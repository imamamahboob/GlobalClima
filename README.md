# Getting started with create-react apps
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
  # 1. Creating this React Project:
 Prerequisites: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
 Required location: Navigate to a directory where you want to create your project, in my case, the globalClima directory.
 Create the project: Open your terminal there and execute the following command:
  ### 'npx create-react-app client'
(Replace my-react-app with your desired project name. In my case, its client.)
 Change directory: Navigate to the newly created app directory by the command:
  ### 'cd client'
 Now install Axios for making API requests because we will be using API here.
  ### 'npm install axios'
 Now start the development server: Run the following command to start the local development
server:
  ### 'npm start'
 Develop your app: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the default React app in your browser. Customize it with your desired components and functionalities. In my case, i developed a weather app named **GlobalClima**.

# Server 
I have developed the application's backend in express. So for this, in the project directory globalClima, open the terminal and run the following command for creating a directory named server.
  ### 'mkdir server'
- Now, enter into the server directory by:
  ### 'cd server'
- Initialize to make a server and install express cors axios by the commands:
  ### 'npm init -y'
  ### 'npm install express cors axios'

# My App GlobalClima
The styling is done in a file named App.css which is imported in the javascript file named App.js. Furthermore, all the functionalities of the application is added in the App.js file. I have developed it to display the temperature and weather condition of the city that you will search by clicking on the button 'See your city's Weather'. Moreover, the icons of weather and weather deatils such as windspeed, humidity, visibility and more can also be added to display on the user interface. But, I have just made it simple.

# Server configuration
For the server to run correctly, I have made required express imports in the index.js file which makes up  the backend of this application. In the index.js file, i have made an API call to the OpenWeatherOrg to fetch weather information for the entered city. This call requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account on the mentioned website and click on the API key tab. It is in free tier. Moreover, in the GET method in the index.js file, I have made to convey an initial information message 'Welcome to the Weather App' that will be displayed on the http://localhost:5000 if the server is working correctly.

# To run the server
 After developing the index.js and index.css files, open a terminal in the server directory location and run the command:
 ### 'node index.js'
- This will run the server at http://localhost:5000 where you will see the display message if it had run error-free.

# NOTE
To run the app after developing it, **BOTH THE SERVER AND CLIENT SIDE SHOULD BE IN RUNNING STATES**
The following commands should be run to ensure smooth working:
### 'node index.js'      (in the server location)
### 'npm start'          (in the client location)


Additional steps: (default instructions generated by the react app)
### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
